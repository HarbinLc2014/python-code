random.randrange(start, stop, step) is equivalent to random.choice(range(start, stop, step)). In particular, random.randrange(start, stop) returns a random integer n such that start <= n < stop. Each possible n is of the form start + i¡Ástep, for some integral i.

For each function, each possible number is equally likely, i.e., the possible numbers are distributed uniformly.
